TO DO:
------

PHASE 1

1) DONE Create Git repository
2) DONE Create barebones Ruby files
3) IN PROGRESS Create specs for example cases in brief
4) Break down requirements into tasks:
    * Rule for BOGO offer on Fruit Tea
    * Reduced price from $5.00 to $4.50 for 3 or more Apples
    * System for setting up pricing rules rather than special cases
    * Initialize method should take pricing_rules parameter
      * Think about how this parameter is formatted
    * 
5) 



PHASE 2

Re-factor with SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY in mind:
  * Any method that is doing more than one thing should be split up into
    separate classes (each with a method for doing that one thing).
  * Raise errors rather than return errors as strings.

REMEMBER:

  * Single responsibility
  * Each spec should only test ONE THING
  * For IRB testing: irb -r ./lib/checkout.rb
