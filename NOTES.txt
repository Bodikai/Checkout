TO DO:
------

PHASE 1

1) Create Git repository
2) Create barebones Ruby files
3) Create specs for example cases in brief
4) Break down requirements into tasks:
    * 
5) 



PHASE 2

Re-factor with SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY in mind:
  * Any method that is doing more than one thing should be split up into
    separate classes (each with a method for doing that one thing).
  * Raise errors rather than return errors as strings.

REMEMBER:

  * Each spec should only test ONE THING
